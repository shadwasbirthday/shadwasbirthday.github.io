				<p>Well that may not be true really, but I am pretty much sure you learned to read before you learned to walk, So I would guess that this is the year when  the obsession started and from that year on you have read god knows how many books and i love that about you i love how smart you are. I am also pretty sure books are the reason I have the most open-minded girlfriend ever. I also love how passionate you are about reading and how you cute you sound when you are excited about books  </p>

The pictures of your first day of school and how excited you must have been and how amazingly adorable and cute you must have looked in your school outfit.
